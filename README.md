# Huffman Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless compression/decompression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequency,
more frequent characters are assigned short codes and less frequent characters are assigned long codes. 

The lossless and space reduction features of Huffman coding make it efficient for data transmission and storage, and it is mainly used in information 
security and encryption. For instance, it is can be used in data security to reduce the size of encrypted files, which results in enhanced communication and 
data storage safety, it can be also used to improve the security of data protection techniques, and it can be combined with other lossless data compression 
algorithms to get a more satisfying compression ratio, or to compress videos in order to reduce the storage space and transmission bandwidth.
